# Background Slider

Small and interesting project made in React JS. Idea for it I saw on multitude
of websites, and intrigued decided to to make it.

Background images are taken from data, put in array, they change automatically
every 5 seconds, user can change them by pressing two sides buttons, or the
buttons on the bottom, which also track images in array by index.

## Install

```sh
npm i && npm start
```

or if you are using Linux and get an errror

sudo npm i && npm start
```

## Used

- useState, useEffect, useCallback
